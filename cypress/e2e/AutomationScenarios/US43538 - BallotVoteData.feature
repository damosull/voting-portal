  Scenario: Verify internal user can revoke access to ACSI column on the ballot vote data report
    Given I am logged in as the "AUTOMATIONINTERNAL" user
    When I navigate to the customers page
    And I search for customer with name "Russell Investments"
    Then I should be able to turn the "ACSI checkbox to YES"
    When I navigate to User Permissions page for "RUSSELL"
    And I click on the "Workflow Meetings Vote Card" dropdown
    Then I change the "View ACSI Recommendations" user permission to "Explicitly Denied"
    And I click on the Submit changes button
    And I should logout from the application
    Given I am logged in as the "RUSSELL" user
    And I navigate to the Reporting page
    And I navigate to the report type page for "Ballot Vote Data"
    When I expand the Configure Columns section
    Then I can verify that the "ACSI" column should "not be visible"
    And I should logout from the application
