  Scenario: Compare Policy Recommendations to GL Recommendations
    Given I am logged in as the "CALPERS" user
    When I navigate to the workflow page
    And I have added the criteria for "Policy Recs With/Against Glass Lewis" and selecting the radio button for "All"
    And I select a random meeting
    Then I can view the Meeting Details page
    And I can verify that all policy recommendations are matching "GL" recommendations
    When I navigate to the workflow page
    And I remove all existing selected criteria
    And I have added the criteria for "Policy Recs With/Against Glass Lewis" and selecting the radio button for "One Against"
    And I select a random meeting
    Then I can view the Meeting Details page
    And I can verify that at least one policy recommendations is against "GL" recommendations
    And I should logout from the application
